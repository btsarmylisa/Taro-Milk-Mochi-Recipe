Making the Mochi:

You can made your own cooked flour by stir fry 2 tbsp of glutinous rice flour or tapioca flour on a dry pan until they are light and slightly yellowish. Alternative you can use Japanese potato starch, they are cooked and ready to be used.

Steaming time vary depending on the dish. The deep dish pan requires longer steaming time, you can stir once halfway through the steaming.

This recipe yield 10 mochi. I made 8 and keep the rest for bread’s filling.

It’s best to use disposable gloves to handle. You can use plastic wrap but it’s not as convenient as disposable gloves.

I used this nature food color powder, add some blue and berry color powder to get purple.

You can eat mochi without filling, just cut the dough into small pieces and coat them with roasted soybean powder (kinako). Add some icing sugar if it’s desired. They are equally delicious.

Making the Taro:

Yield about 300g taro filling. This taro paste is great for mochi, snow skin mooncake or bread’s filling. Can be used for mooncake, but make sure the taro paste is thicker. You can either cook the paste longer or add extra 1/2 tsp of flour.

Can replace all purpose flour with wheat starch.

Add some purple sweet potato powder while you cook the taro paste in order to get purplish taro paste. 
Alternatively you can steam together some purple sweet potato with the taro.

Wrap taro paste with plastic wrap before storing in air-tight container. Keep the taro paste in refrigerator or freezer to prolong the shelf life.
