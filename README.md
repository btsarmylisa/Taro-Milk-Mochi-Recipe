Taro mochi is a traditional 'wagashi' or Japanese treat that is usually eaten during the New Year festivities. 

Plain mochi by itself usually has a subtle sweetness to it. During the process of making it into a soft and chewy cake, salt is added to activate the taste of the glutinous rice. We feel that this makes the sweetness of the rice more apparent.

Even when eating plain, you will be able to enjoy its pleasant taste. However, we would like to highlight that the dessertâ€™s primary excellence comes from its texture. It has a floaty yet firm feeling when bitten into and chewed.
